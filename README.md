# Crop-yield-prediction
Introduction

In this project, I aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on historical weather data, soil conditions, and farming practices. Predicting crop yield is crucial for farmers and agricultural stakeholders to optimize their resources and make informed decisions. This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial by @611artificialintelligence where the steps were demonstrated in detail.

Objective of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and reliable machine learning model that can predict crop yields. This involves data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.

Data Source

For this project, I used a dataset that includes historical weather data, soil conditions, and farming practices. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset
